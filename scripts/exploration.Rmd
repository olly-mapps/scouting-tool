# Libraries

We first load in the necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(worldfootballR)
```

# Data Loading

We want to load both the possession differences we generated, and the raw possession stats from fbref

```{r}
poss_raw <- data.frame(load_fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(stat_type = "possession", 
                                             team_or_player = "player"))
poss_diff <- read.csv("../Data/possession_changes.csv")
```

# More Data Wrangling

```{r}
arrange(possession, desc(Succ_Take))
```
